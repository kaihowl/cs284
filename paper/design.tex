\subsection{WSN as a DB}
 Simulating wireless network as virtual database is an emerging area of research interest. The most popular data model in use today is the relational data model. These are nothing but the relational view of the data generated by the sensor network. SQL type interface is present which provides a way to query on data using various SQL operators such as join. The main goal of WSN as database is to preserve the location transparency. So the idea is to allow the  application user to generate the query on sensor network without having knowledge of the topology, which is taken care by the infrastructure.  This makes the system modular.  Sensornet database achieves energy efficiency by giving approximate results.

\subsection{Sleeping Scheme}
/* what do we understand under sleeping and how did we implement it? */


\subsection{Front-end design}
/* This subsection on the front-end (server) that will take queries and process them and transform them to light-weight queries sent to the sensors */
The front-end design consists of a web based user interface listing the wireless sensor nodes present in the topology. This UI queries the data from a back-end MySql database. There is a provision to drill down the report on the basis of attributes such as nodeId, floor number.

\subsubsection{Query processing}
/* The process of breaking the query to simpler light-weight queries. How data is assembled from nodes etc */
We have implemented the query processor to fetch the data from nodes based on the attributes such as their physical location (which is floor number in our case). The query interface will fetch the details of all nodes that satisfies the condition (ie floor number in our case) and then send query request packets to them. The result of this query gets stored in the database and it can be used later to perform any analysis. So the role of query interface is to filter the nodes based on the query condition and then stores the result into  the database.

%\subsubsection{Concurrency gurantees}
%/* I was thinking that we should add actuators to our system. For example, a sensor to detect if the light is on and is capable of turning the light on/off (or something like, if the temperature is above 25 deg. turn AC on). What is here is how to gurantee that a query is right. I propose to treat it as timestamp-based concurrency management, and the proof of correctness is available. Also, we should talk that a property of this scheme is that a correct behavior is maintained while that we always accept read requests, but a write can be rejected.
%BTW, I beleive this is VEEEERY novel, they usually talk about sensing only.

\subsection{Back-end design}

\subsection{Hardware}
We are using three Arduino Uno microcontrollers as end nodes in our prototype topology. Each of these microcontrollers is connected to a XBee Series 2 module for wireless communication. A fourth XBee module is directly connected to a computer and acts as the coordinator of the network.

\subsection{Software}
The host connected to the XBee controller is running a LAMP-stack, i.e. a linux machine equipped with apache, MySQL, and PHP.
