This paper explores a simple network topology in wireless sensor networks (WSN). Three endnodes connected to a coordinator. Each endnode is connected to a battery. In order to maximize network longetivity, the sleeping time of each of the endnodes is maximized while the delay for the response time is limited. This paper contributes a model describing the connection between sleeping duration, workload, and delay in a given topology. The model is evaluated on a hardware testbed as well as in simulations.
